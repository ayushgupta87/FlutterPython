This is my own mini practice project for learning (very very very basic.. for my own understanding)

How to work with Python backend and flutter frontend

now we can integrate ML, and all the stuff in our flutter app


this have 4 simple http request .. get, post, delete and put

If you have some cool ideas please tell me

next i will be learning about websockets


=> Run Python server first

1. for 'get all list, items' - no need to fill name and price form ... It will retrieve all the data
2. for 'get a item' - fill Name form to retrieve specific item
3. for 'post data' - fill both name and price.. it will add item
4. 'delete data' - just fill name field to delete specific item
5. 'Put data' - fill Name and price both --- if item is not present it will add new item, if item is present it will update price of item.
